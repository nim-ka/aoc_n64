 * into C code. However, there are some cases where that would not match, where
 * addresses are loaded using lui/ori rather than lui/addiu.
 * To avoid duplication, this file is included from sm64.ld. We make sure not
 * to cast the addresses to pointers in this file, since that would be invalid
 * linker script syntax.
